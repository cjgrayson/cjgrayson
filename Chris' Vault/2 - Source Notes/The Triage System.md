### The Triage System

### 1. The Daily Reset

Inspired by hospital practices where doctors use daily disposable task lists:

- Start each day with a fresh piece of paper
- Write tasks as they come in
- Discard the list at day's end

Key benefit: The physical act of writing tasks forces conscious prioritization decisions.

### 2. The Morning Manifesto

A 3-5 minute daily planning ritual with three components:

- Prime: Connect with body and practice gratitude
- Remind: Review quarterly goals and weekly outcomes
- Plan: Identify today's most important task and 1-3 additional priorities
-

### 3. The Box Method

A sophisticated task tracking system using visual indicators:

- Diagonal line: Task started
- Half-shaded box: Task 50% complete
- Fully shaded and crossed: Task complete

This method provides clear status visibility and creates motivating progress indicators.

### 4. Real-Time Triage

The continuous process of re-evaluating and reprioritizing tasks as new information and demands arise. This ensures the most important tasks receive immediate attention, regardless of when they appear on the list.
